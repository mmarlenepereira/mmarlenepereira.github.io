            My name is Maria, and I got to know about your traineship program for new programmers and I'd like to participate in the program. 
            <p>I have no previous experience as a programmer, as I am still learning, but I believe a hands-on experience will help me to further develop the programming skills I'm developping at NCI.</p>
            <p>I started the <i><a href="https://www.ncirl.ie/Courses/NCI-Course-Details/course/HDCOMPWEB" target="_blank">Higher Diploma in Science In Computing - Web Development</a></i> in September, and in the next year, I'll be learning Java, SQL, HTML and CSS.</p>
            In <a href="cv.html" target="_blank">my CV</a> you can find more details about my professional and academic background. And if additional information is required, just <a href="mailto:x22115234@student.ncirl.ie" target="_blank">email me</a>. I'll be happy to provide any additional details you might require.
            <p></p>
            Thank you very much!

            I am looking forward to joining you soon!
